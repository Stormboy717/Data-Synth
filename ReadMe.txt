Medical Incident Report Generator

This script generates a fake medical incident report using OpenAI's GPT-3 language model and saves it as a PDF document. The report includes incident details, medical assessment, and a treatment plan. The generated PDF report follows a pamphlet-style design with incident details on top and shaded text boxes for medical assessment and treatment plan side by side.
